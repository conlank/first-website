            <h1>Conlan</h1>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Conlan is transitioning from benchtop science towards roles that allow him to apply his experience of the scientific process for creative endeavors that allow him to explore the intersection between math, science, and art.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Conlan's interest in exploring the border between organic and inorganic forms blossomed during his studies. He began to explore the aesthetics of the brain,
                After observing the structure of the brain first hand, I wanted to find a way to blend the predictability of math and science with the organic patterns of biology. By using the language of math I have begun to explore the patterns expressed in biology and nature.</p>


            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>Conlan is a published neuroscience researcher with a focus on translative research. During his Masters' degree he developed an appreciation for microscopy, imaging, and image processing. A friend introduced him to 3D printers and other fabrication robots, which immediately captured his focus. Conlan has recently focused his attention on programming, generative design, and creating fabrication robotics.</p>
